*Big thanks to Meka who inspired me to make this app list. It was originally designed to be a repo, but I wanted to have these apps out for you guys to use. I will personally update this list and add apps when possible, maybe even from your requests* 

*A repo will come soon I'm still working on it*

*These apps are specifically tailored for the use of [Altstore](https://altstore.io) and [Sidestore](https://sidestore.io) in mind (<u>They can still be used with other sideloading methods as well</u>). As a former free developer account user of SideStore, I know the pain in having apps take up all AppIDs. In result of this I have removed all extra plugins for these apps; each app will only take up **ONE** AppID.
In addtion, most, if not all apps, are made for higher ios versions **17.0+** due to the fact that ios versions below have Trollstore/Jailbreak*

*Big thanks to **swaggyP36000/TrollStore-IPAs** for giving me inspiration on the layout of this repo*


## Additional Information
- **Credit to the Respective Owner/Contributor:** Needless to say, the hard work invested by the respective maintainers is very important and, not to be neglected, all the IPAs that I have are updated at a location in one central collection with much respect toward their creators-first and foremost. The credit is very much needed and stands upfront since they reflect the commitment of that particular individual in their works.

- **Resources:** All files and can be found in **Assets** folder. Other than that I have listed the apps down below as well so it is easier to find. Feel free to **CMD + F** to search for the app you are looking for. 

- **Disclaimer:** Some apps may be in a lower version than the current app store version due to technical issues. An example of this is **Instagram**, which is on a lower version due to the newer versions having a bug where you get logged out everytime you close the app.
